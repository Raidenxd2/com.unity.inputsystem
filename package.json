    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Expanded `RebindingUISample` to include a \"game mode\" state and a \"menu state\" to be more similar to a real game. Also added action-performed indicators (`InputActionIndicator`) illustrating when actions get triggered.\n\n### Added\n- Exposed MediaPlayPause, MediaRewind, MediaForward keys on Keyboard.\n- Added a new fluent API `WithSuppressedActionPropagation()` to `UnityEngine.InputSystem.InputActionRebindingExtensions` that allows suppressing actions from firing during interactive rebinding while allowing state updates to avoid actions triggering after state event suppression (default). ISXB-1546.\n- Added a new Monobehavior `InputActionLabel` to rebinding sample to allow dynamic text showing relevant binding for an `InputAction`.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue in `RebindingUISample` that fired actions bound to the same control as the target control in a rebinding process. ISXB-1524.\n- Fixed an issue in `RebindingUISample` preventing UI navigation without Keyboard and Mouse present.\n- Fixed an issue in `RebindActionUI` which resulted in active binding not being shown after a scene reload. ISXB-1588.\n- Fixed an issue in `GamepadIconExample` which resulted in icons for left and right triggers not being displayed after a rebind to the exact same controls. ISXB-1593.\n- Fixed the compilation warnings when used with Unity 6.4 (ISX-2349).\n- Fixed an issue where `InputSystemUIInputModule.localMultiPlayerRoot` could not be set to `null` when using `MultiplayerEventSystem`. [ISXB-1610](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1610)\n- Fixed an issue in `Keyboard` where the sub-script operator would return a `null` key control for the deprecated key `Key.IMESelected`. Now, an aliased `KeyControl`mapping to the IMESelected bit is returned for compability reasons. It is still strongly advised to not rely on this key since `IMESelected` bit isn't strictly a key and will be removed from the `Key` enumeration type in a future major revision. [ISXB-1541](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1541).\n- Fixed InputControl picker not updating correctly when the Input Actions Window was dirty. [ISXB-1221](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1221)\n- Fixed formatting issues on processor documentation page"
